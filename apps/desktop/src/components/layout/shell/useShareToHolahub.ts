// BrowserView; navigating to the SAME "/compose" is a no-op (the atom doesn't
// change and main's warm-reopen short-circuits), so a second share would never
// re-mount the compose gate. A per-share nonce forces a fresh navigation → the
// gate re-mounts and consumes the newly staged draft.
//
// Clock-based, not a counter: a counter lives only as long as this module, so a
// renderer reload restarts it at 1 and the next share re-uses a nonce the
// still-warm surface has already consumed — it then skips the new draft and
// leaves the previous one on screen. The suffix keeps two shares inside the same
// millisecond apart.
